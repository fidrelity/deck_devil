Magic Deck building Guide

1. Intro
1.1 how i came to build my own decks

Back in 1998 when I was just 8 years old and just started playing Magic: The Gathering with my friends, the task of Deck building was easy. Make a big pile of what I assumed to be my strongest creatures, add my fancy foils, load a good mix of lands on top of that and we're all set. To be fair, Magic: The Gathering is fairly complex for kids without having good help and we didn't even have internet access back then. So you didn't win games with the best deck, you won them by arguing and convincing your friends. Imagine Socrates in the Akropolis convincing the crowd of why he can play that Sorcery during an opponents turn. That was us back then.

1.2 why it's amazing

16 years later my friends and I still play Magic: The Gathering. But now we're all equipped with smartphones and can google card rulings in an instant. There's very little space for open discussion. And when you start carefully obliging the Magic: The Gathering rules, two things start to happen:
1. You start enjoying the game more, because there's no one card that totally breaks the game for everybody
2. Your brain starts to combine more and more of the Magic: The Gathering mechanics, creating a spring of ever new deck ideas.

The moment this spring is revealed, that's when you're ready for building your first deck. I enjoy deck building just as much as playing with the actual deck. And it's fascinating how much my theory of a perfect deck and the actual reality of that deck are sometimes very far apart, a paradox that reminds me of communism. Here's a basic guide for beginners to get started easier with your first deck.


2. Deck building

2.1 Ask yourself "How will I win?"
When you got that far, chances are you already have a slight clue of what you want to build your deck around.
It could either be:
  - Your favourite card that's just to cool not to be played
  - a fun combo that you want to dig
  - or maybe just start with a few cards of your favourite color

Let's call these three to four cards your decks' core. These are the cards you want to finish the game with. Generally it's a good idea to put these cards 4 times in your deck (that's the allowed maximum). You should now have around 12 cards in your deck.

Every deck needs lands. For now, let's just assume a number of 24 lands. This number may vary depending on your color and strategy selection. Congratulations! Your deck is now already half-way complete!

Set boundaries

Let's set some boundaries to your further deck building.
The one thing many beginners get wrong is the deck size. It's dead simple: 60 cards. Not more or less. Adding more cards because you can't make up your mind won't do you any good. It's less likely that you will draw the "core cards" and you'll have to add more mana. You're diluting the essence of your deck.

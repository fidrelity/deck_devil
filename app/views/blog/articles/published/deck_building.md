Back in 1998 when I was just 8 years old and just started playing Magic: The Gathering with my friends, the task of Deck building was easy: Make a big pile of what I assumed to be my best creatures, add my fancy foils, load a good mix of lands on top of that and I was all set. To be fair Magic: The Gathering is fairly complex and we didn't even have internet access back then. You didn't win games with the best deck, you won them by arguing and convincing your friends. Imagine Socrates in the Akropolis convincing the crowd of why he can play that Sorcery during an opponents turn. That was us back then.

16 years later my friends and I still play Magic: The Gathering. But now we're all equipped with smartphones and can google card rulings in an instant. There's very little space for open discussion. And when you start carefully obliging the Magic: The Gathering rules, two things happen:
1. You start enjoying the game more, because there's no single card that totally breaks the game for everybody
2. Your brain starts to combine more and more of the Magic: The Gathering mechanics, creating a spring of ever new deck ideas.

The moment this spring is revealed, that's when you're ready for building your first deck. I enjoy deck building just as much as playing with the actual deck. And it's fascinating how much my theory of a perfect deck and the actual reality of that deck are sometimes very far apart. I want to give you a basic guide for beginners to get started easier with your first deck.


== Start with a color
The two first decisions you should make for your deck are which colors you want to play and which strategy your deck should follow.

=== Color
In Magic: The Gathering you have 5 different colors to choose from. They all have a certain character and theme and offer various ways of shaping your game. It's good advice to focus on one color for the beginnig as it makes your deck building simpler. Playing with 2 colors is also fine, but take care of balancing your deck correctly. We'll get to this point later on.

==== Strategy
Ask yourself this question: 'how will I win?'. Don't forget that your opponent is playing too and you don't want his or her deck to kill you before you even get your game going. Now here are two general strategies how you can prevent that:

- Aggression: A typical "aggro" deck is lightning fast in build-up and wrecks your opponent before he even gets started. That means cheap creatures and quick damage output.

- Control: On the opposite side of the spectrum are control decks. With this kind of deck you're trying to contain all opponent's threats to you and cut his or her resources. The most basic resource is "cards", but some decks just destroy your lands or remove all your creatures. When your opponent is contained successfully your finisher comes in the game and ends it.


== Start the deck building

Before we get started picking cards, let us decide on some limitations.

*60 cards is all you need*
The one thing many beginners get wrong is the deck size. It's dead simple: 60 cards. Not more or less. Adding more cards because you can't make up your mind won't do you any good. It's less likely that you will draw your best cards and you'll have to add more lands. You're diluting the essence of your deck.

*4 of a kind*
Here's a well known secret: Some cards are just better than others. Some of those are easy to spot, others reveal their power only once you've seen it in action. Of our best cards we will use 4 copies in our deck. You're only allowed to have the same card 4 times in your deck (lands are an exception).

=== Part I: Your core

Now let's find your inspiration
Maybe by now you have a slight clue of how your deck should work. Maybe you want to build a deck around either of these:
  - Your favourite card that's just to cool not to be played
  - Or a fun combo that you want to dig
  - a creature type you fancy ("tribal decks")

Pick three to five cards that serve that purpose. Let's call these cards your decks' core. Those are the cards you want to win the game with. Generally it's a good idea to put these cards 4 times in your deck as we said before. You should now have around 12-20 cards in your deck. If you have no idea where to get these cards from, do a bit of a research. tappedout.net has a great community and serves as a big inspiration for myself. Just start googling what cought your attention. Maybe you want a "heroic" deck or an army of Zombies, or build a deck around a planeswalker you got. There are many forums out there where you can get card suggestions.

Every deck needs lands. For now, let's just add 24 lands. This number may vary depending on your color and strategy selection. Congratulations! Your deck is now already half-way complete!

=== Part II: Your sidekick
We're now missing about 20-30 cards of your 60 cards deck. We want to add cards now that support your core and your strategy. If you've decided to play "aggro" we're looking for cheap creatures, or instants that "buff up" your creatures to swing with more damage. If you want to control the board, we're looking for counter, discard or destruction spells.

Here are some concrete examples what you might want for your deck:
- Spells to protect your creatures
- Spells to destroy your opponents' creatures
- Create card advantage by drawing more cards
- Slow down your opponent by destroying his lands
- Inflict direct damage to a player

Make a long list of cards that could fit in your deck. Then look at mana costs, card prices and the cards' flexibility (how likely will you be able to use it?) and order them by these factors. Simple take the top cards of that list and fill your deck. You should have your first draft of your deck ready by now.

== Analysis
*Strike a balance*
It's time to evaluate your first draft. If you're playing a multicolored deck, have a look if your deck is well balanced in color. Count all the mana symbols in your cards' costs. In most cases you should aim for a 50/50 distribution, this should also define your land color ratio. So if half your cards are black, the other half is White, you should play 50% swamps and 50% plains as your lands.

Creatures are just one card type of many others in Magic: The Gathering, but there are very few decks that can live without them. As a rule of thumb aim for at least 14 creatures. This can vary of course depending on your strategy. Maybe you have some kick-ass combo and you really need a lot less creatures - but those are special cases.

*Mana curve*
I'm now going to introduce a very important topic for deck building: Your mana curve. Your mana curve tells you how expensive your spells are overall. Here's an example:

You want to be able to cast creatures and other spells on early turns but don't forget about the late game. So if you're only beginning with Magic: The Gathering you should aim for an evenly balanced mana curve.

*Adapt your lands*
From the knowledge gained now you should re-evaluate your number of lands. We started with 24 lands. If you've built a rather cheap deck (I'm talking about mana cost here) you might go as low as to only play 20 lands. If you've went for a control deck with expensive spells, the number might go up to 28 lands.

Remember if you add or remove cards from your deck, go back a step and limit your deck to 60 cards.


*Prepare for battle*
Enough planning for now. You can imagine how your deck will be better for days and nights, but there's a better option to find out: Play! Get your friends together and test your deck. Don't worry if your strategy isn't working in the first match, statistically speaking even a 100 games are not enough to test your deck properly. Try to play against as many different decks as possible to evaluate your deck against various strategies. If you've gained enough insights, go back and alter your deck. You might want to add some lands, kick out some expensive spells or add some creatures. You'll get to know your deck better with every match and don't get frustrated if it doesn't work out in the first run.

*Summary*
Deck building is supposed to be fun! Don't get overwhelmed with the complexity and variety of the Magic: The Gathering universe, just pick what looks interesting and start from there. You'll learn with every match and every deck built and if a deck doesn't work at all, don't force yourself to play it. Collect your ideas and start over!

I'm going to release further guides along the way and I'll also talk about my deck creations that I'm going to put on sale here on deckdevil.com/decks. I'm more than happy to hear from you on what you'd like to read more about and which decks you'd be interested in. Just leave a comment or send me a mail.
